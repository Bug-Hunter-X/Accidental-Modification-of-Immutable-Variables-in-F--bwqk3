This repository demonstrates a common error in F# programming: attempting to modify immutable variables.  The `bug.fs` file shows code that incorrectly tries to modify immutable variables within a function. The `bugSolution.fs` file provides the corrected code.

**Key Concepts:**
* Mutable vs. Immutable Variables in F#
* Common error when mixing mutable and immutable variable handling
* Correct usage of `mutable` keyword
